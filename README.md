# CompARE  

## Description

This repository contains the R functions for the shiny-app CompARE (https://cinna.upc.edu/compare/). CompARE is a web-platform inspired to provide help on issues relating to trials with composite endpoints.

The repository also contains the source files of the papers:

	* Selection of composite binary endpoints in clinical trials. Biom J. 2018 Mar; 60(2):246-261. 
	
	* Sample size derivation for composite binary endpoints. Stat in Med. DOI: 10.1002/sim.8092.
