# CompARE  

## Description

This repository contains R functions for the design and analysis of trials with binary composite endpoints as well as the source files of the papers:

	* Selection of composite binary endpoints in clinical trials. Biom J. 2018 Mar; 60(2):246-261. 
	
	* Sample size derivation for composite binary endpoints. Stat in Med. DOI: 10.1002/sim.8092.

Some of the functions included here are also covered in the R package CompAREdesign (https://cran.r-project.org/package=CompAREdesign) and used for the shiny-app CompARE (https://cinna.upc.edu/compare/). Further information about CompARE can be found at: https://github.com/CompARE-Composite/CompARE-package
